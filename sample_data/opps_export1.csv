 United States",""," Early Career and Emerging in Field","The Social Science Research Council invites applications from early career researchers for two year-long fellowships to conduct qualitative studies of arts organizations founded by, with, and for communities of color in the United States and Puerto Rico. These fellowships will form part of the SSRC&rsquo;s Arts Research with Communities of Color (ARCC) program and the Wallace Foundation&rsquo;s current initiative in the arts.<br/> <br/> Partnering with the Wallace Foundation in its new initiative on how arts organizations of color leverage their community orientation towards resilience and relevance, the program facilitates primarily ethnographic research projects that match early career research fellows with arts organizations funded by the Foundation for a 12-month period. The aim is to collaboratively produce in-depth studies of their histories, organizational cultures, and relationships with and approaches to the artistic or cultural community they serve. In addition, the research will explore how organizations maintain their relevance, how they define and maintain their resilience, and how they perceive their impact(s), insights that will also contribute to the initiative and the field of the arts more broadly.","https://www.ssrc.org/programs/arts-research-with-communities-of-color-program-arcc/2023-ssrc-arts-research-with-communities-of-color-fellowship-request-for-proposals/","https://pivot.proquest.com/funding_opps/52e8a66a-29f2-40af-aa78-f2f1552f7976"," Arts and Culture
