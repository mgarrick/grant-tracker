 Mid-Career to Established in Field","Half of all Crohn&#39;s disease (CD) patients will develop disease complications, one which is development of fibrotic strictures (fibrostenosis), leading to GI tract obstruction and severe clinical consequences. Fibrostenosis is also a serious problem for ulcerative colitis (UC) with approximately 8% incidence over the lifetime. Currently there is no clinical solution for preventing or treating fibrostenosis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), except for surgical intervention. Therefore, there is a great unmet need to understand fibrotic complications in IBD and how to prevent and treat them.<br/> <br/> The Crohn&#39;s &amp; Colitis Foundation in collaboration with Takeda seeks to fund studies focused on investigating the biological mechanisms leading to, and protecting from, fibrosis in IBD. These studies should be built upon clinical observations and/or published evidence in human IBD. Particular interest will be on proposals that address one or more of the following areas: <ul> <li>Pathophysiology of fibrosis and patient segmentation/endotyping based on multi-omics analysis</li> <li>Datasets and biosamples derived from demographically and ethnically diverse cohorts are also preferred.</li> <li>Evaluation of therapeutic potential of modulating specific fibrotic pathways</li> <li>Cell biological mechanisms of fibrosis</li> <li>Role of microbiome</li> <li>Multidisciplinary approaches.</li> </ul>",https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/fibrosis-ibd-research-initiative,https://pivot.proquest.com/funding_opps/04e5ed0b-2e04-44f1-8fa3-d1d75de8f0f3," Cell & Developmental Biology

Projects that consider the effects of sleep on child psychological outcomes such as behavioural, emotional or cognitive, are also welcomed.<br/><br/>Researchers based at any university worldwide may apply, however applications from the UK may be favoured due to better cost efficiency. PIs must have a PhD. Applications that help junior researchers progress in their fields are encouraged. Research projects may be funded through charities, however it is preferred that the PI be based at a university and that charity organisations and workers be included as co-applicants.<br/><br/>Grants are usually worth between £40,000 and £65,000 per project.",http://www.waterloofoundation.org.uk/ChildDevelopmentAboutTheProgramme.html,https://pivot.proquest.com/funding_opps/02f97f5e-1857-4ebc-a547-d1d75de8f0f3," Child Development
