DHTs allowed for the continuation of health care and clinical trials while minimizing the risk of spreading COVID-19. These circumstances helped demonstrate the value and feasibility of using DHTs in clinical trials.<br/> <br/> The PhRMA Foundation recognizes the need to enhance diversity in clinical trials, and the use of digital health tools also has the potential to support more equitable participation in medical research. Through this new program, the Foundation will invest in research on the use of DHTs in underrepresented populations in clinical trials to advance FDA regulatory decision-making.","https://www.phrmafoundation.org/awards/other-opportunities/digital-health-technologies/","https://pivot.proquest.com/funding_opps/8cd6fa7f-d748-4224-b339-f2f1552f7976"," Community Health

 Mid-Career to Established in Field","The Frontier Award is a new funding opportunity in the PhRMA Foundation&rsquo;s Value Assessment and Health Outcomes Research (VA-HOR) Program that seeks research proposals for empirical studies that apply a published value assessment framework to determine the value of a health care intervention, such as a drug, device, or other health-related technology. Submissions that propose novel approaches to patient-centered value assessment (e.g., expand beyond traditional quality-adjusted survival outcomes) are desired. Projects that involve data collected from patients, utilize real-world data sources, or incorporate health preference evidence are particularly welcomed. Projects that propose methodological advances with no clearly defined patient-partnered data component will not be considered.","https://www.phrmafoundation.org/awards/other-opportunities/frontier-award/","https://pivot.proquest.com/funding_opps/409aa100-a839-4c31-a83d-f2f1552f7976"," Health Care
